# Advanced-Macropad - By Maciej Zajaczkowski

I have built an advanced custom macropad with one joystick, 2 mouse scroll rotary encoders, 2 permanent buttons, 1 mode switch buttons and a matrix of 16 buttons (4 of which
are breakout buttons - ie for foot pedals), 1 master switch and a reset button. 

Cherry MX brown switches were used for 15* the buttons. That is 12 + 2 + 1. Big shoutout to Cherry MX for creating such high quality switches.

As for the code and functionality, the macropad has up to 12 pages of functions and includes functions and/or libraries that I have created for inputting Unicode and automatically 
drawing shapes with a the cursor on the press of a buttons.
