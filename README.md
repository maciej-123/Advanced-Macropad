# Advanced-Macropad - By Maciej Zajaczkowski

I have built an advanced custom macropad with one joystick, 2 mouse scroll rotary encoders, 2 permanent buttons, 1 mode switch buttons and a matrix of 16 buttons (4 of which
are breakout buttons - ie for foot pedals), 1 master switch and a reset button. 

I used mouse scroll rotary encoders instead of the ones typically used in macropads as they are smaller and allowed me to implement a scroll wheel in the horizontal direction.
Cherry MX brown switches were used for 15* the buttons. That is 12 + 2 + 1. Great switches - I highly recommend them.

As for the code and functionality, the macropad has up to 12 pages of functions and includes functions and/or libraries that I have created for automatically inputting Unicode via "unicodeinput.exe" and automatically drawing shapes with a the cursor on the press of a buttons.

These libraries include NicoHood's HID-project Library. I thus attribute him and provide a link for reference:

The 12 pages include:

-Special Characters for German, Spanish, Polish and French.äöüß ñ¿¡áéíóúü ąęłńżźśćó çœàâéêîïùûèë.

-Mathematical signs and symbols such as ±∞√∝∑∫∮∗⨯∇∂≡≈π°∥⟂∀∴Δδ∠.

-Controlling video games with multiple button presses. WASD joystick, scrolling to look around and macrokeys that can autoclick weapons at high speeds.

-Automatically opening apps and websites with one buttons.

-A Joystick mouse with 2 axis scrolling and macros such as triple click and buttons to accurately control cursor and scrolling.

-Multimedia Control with Volume and Brightness control via buttons and rotary encoders, buttons for Play/Pause, Mute and joystick to rewind/fast forward video.

-Generic controls such as Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V as well as Ctrl+W and Ctrl+Shift+T for opening and closing tabs in google chrome.
